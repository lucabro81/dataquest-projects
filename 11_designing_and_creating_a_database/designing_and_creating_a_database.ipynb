    "We will be working with a file of [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball) games from [Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org/). Retrosheet compiles detailed statistics on baseball games from the 1800s through to today. The main file we will be working from `game_log.csv`, has been produced by combining 127 separate CSV files from retrosheet, and has been pre-cleaned to remove some inconsistencies. The game log has hundreds of data points on each game which we will normalize into several separate tables using SQL, providing a robust database of game-level statistics.\n",
    "\n",

    "* `person_codes.csv`\n",
    "* `team_codes.csv`\n",
